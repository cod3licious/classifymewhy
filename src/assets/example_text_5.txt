In 1981, DFCI and several other institutions in the United States and Canada formed the DFCI ALL Consortium. The therapeutic backbone of Consortium trials included an intensive, multiagent induction phase, 20-30 weeks of asparaginase during post-remission consolidation, and frequent vincristine/corticosteroid pulses during the continuation phase. On Protocol 81-01 (1981-5), the first study conducted by the Consortium, patients were stratified for the first time into two risk groups. Therapy was de-intensified for patients considered at lower risk of relapse based on age, leukocyte count and immunophenotype; such patients received lower cumulative doses of both anthracycline and corticosteroid. The overall EFS for patients enrolled on that study (74% at 5 years) was relatively favorable compared with contemporaneous childhood ALL trials, especially for children with T-cell ALL (5-year EFS 77%).(3)
Clinical trials conducted between 1985-2000 focused on improving survival rates while minimizing acute and late toxicities.(4-7) Strategies which were tested to improve survival included: substitution of dexamethasone for prednisone during post-induction therapy (Protocol 91-01),(6) use of high-dose intravenous (IV) instead of standard-dose oral 6-mercaptopurine during the first of year of treatment (Protocol 91-01),(6) addition of high-dose methotrexate during the remission induction phase,(5) and intensification of treatment for patients considered at very high risk of relapse, including patients with presenting leukocyte counts > 100 x 109/L and infants (Protocols 85-01, 87-01 and 91-01).(4, 5, 8)Attempts to reduce toxicity included: testing administration of doxorubicin by continuous infusion (Protocol 91-01) and the addition of a cardioprotectant, dexrazoxane (Protocol 95-01) in high risk patients to minimize anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity,(6, 7) testing alternative preparations of asparaginase (Protocols 91-01 and 95-01),(6, 7) and substituting intrathecal chemotherapy for cranial radiation in lower risk patients (Protocols 87-01 and 95-01).(5, 7) In this report, we update the results of the four consecutive clinical trials conducted by the DFCI ALL Consortium between 1985-2000.
