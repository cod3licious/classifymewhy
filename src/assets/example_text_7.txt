Sensitivity and specificity ROC curves were generated automatically for each colour and maximal box size with a window range of 0.0025.
To determine whether there were significant differences between diagnostic groups, and since raw lacunarity values were skewed and could not be normalised by a suitable transformation, lacunarity values were compared using a three way non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis) and a two-way non-parametric test (Wilcoxon Rank Sum).
To assess whether there were any differences between diagnostic groups regarding their fractal dimension and degree of self-similarity (Pearson's correlation coefficient) non-parametric tests were used (Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank Sum) since these data were skewed and could not be transformed to normality.
To assess the correlation between the clinical irregularity scores and lacunarity values, Spearman's rank correlation was calculated using an index of 1 to 6 for clinical irregularity scores, and lacunarity values in the red spectrum at intermediate box size for each image. Finally, to assess the inter-observer agreement in clinical irregularity scores, a linear-weighted kappa statistic was evaluated.
