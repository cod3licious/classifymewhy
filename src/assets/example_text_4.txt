In addition to the sequence analysis of the individual kidney tissue pair, we conducted an in-group sequence comparison of pooled amplicons obtained from the tumor and normal tissues following conversion, amplification and normalization of DNA. Thirty-five (5.5%) and 67 (10.5%) of 640 CpG sites analyzed in total were found to be methylated in the normal and tumor tissue group, respectively (Fig. 5). Assuming each CpG methylation as an independent event, statistical analysis showed that tumor and normal tissue groups demonstrated significant differences in methylation frequency (P < 0.001, chi-square test).
Analysis of RASSF1A promoter methylation and RASSF1A expression in CaSki and HEK293 cell lines
To detect RASSF1A protein in paraffin embedded tumoral and normal kidney tissue we first examined the specificity of the RASSF1A antibody using paraffin embedded sediments of control cell lines CaSki and HEK293. We found strong immunopositivity in the cytoplasm of CaSki cells (Fig. 6a[i]). This corresponds with a lack of RASSF1A promoter methylation as detected by COBRA (Fig. 6a). Moreover, immunopositivity can be specifically blocked by the peptide used for immunization (Fig. 6a[ii]). On the contrary, we detected almost complete methylation of RASSF1A in the embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, which is associated with significantly decreased cytoplasmic immunopositivity (Fig. 6b[i]). As expected this finding is not affected by peptide blocking of the antibody (Fig. 6b[ii]). Faint nuclear positivity, appears as heterogeneous pattern in antibody incubations of HEK293 independently of the presence of a blocking peptide, suggesting a residual unspecific nuclear binding of the polyclonal antibody. However, only cytoplasmic immunopositivity has been considered for evaluation of tissue sections.
